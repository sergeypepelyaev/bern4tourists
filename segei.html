  <h1 class="title">History</h1>
  <div class="text">
    <p>
      The city of Bern was officially founded in 1191 by Duke Berchtold V of Zähringen, who chose a 
      natural peninsula formed by the River Aare as the site for his new settlement. The river provided 
      both protection and resources, making it an ideal location for a fortified town. According to local 
      legend, the Duke declared that the city would be named after the first animal he encountered during 
      a hunt in the surrounding forest. That animal happened to be a bear, and ever since, the bear has 
      remained the proud emblem of Bern, appearing on its coat of arms, seals, and in traditions that 
      continue to this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its early years, Bern developed as a compact medieval settlement, with narrow streets, watchtowers, 
      and timber houses clustered within its defensive walls. The city quickly became a center of trade 
      and governance in the region, benefiting from its strategic position between the Jura Mountains and 
      the Swiss Plateau. The construction of stone arcades and fountains during the late Middle Ages gave 
      Bern a distinctive character that still shapes its appearance today. These arcades, stretching for 
      kilometers, allowed merchants to display their goods while offering shelter from rain and snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the centuries, Bern grew in influence and prosperity, gradually acquiring more land and 
      establishing itself as a leading member of the Swiss Confederation. Its central role in Swiss 
      politics and trade was reinforced by its steady expansion, the rebuilding of houses in local 
      sandstone, and the addition of civic monuments such as the Zytglogge clock tower. The city also 
      played a key role in regional conflicts, with its defensive walls and towers standing as symbols 
      of strength and independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, the story of Bern's founding still lives on in its traditions and landscape. The Bear Park 
      on the edge of the Old Town honors the city's emblematic animal, while the medieval street plan 
      preserves the vision of its original builders. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site, Bern's 
      Old Town reflects more than 800 years of continuous history, connecting the legend of its foundation 
      with its enduring role as Switzerland's political heart and cultural treasure.
