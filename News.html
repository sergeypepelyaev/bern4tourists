    <h3>Gaza demonstration in Bern</h3>
    <p>
    An unauthorized pro-Palestine demonstration escalated in downtown Bern on Saturday afternoon. 
    Around 5,000 people moved from the train station to Bundesplatz and back again, 
    to protest against Israeli warfare in the Gaza Strip. 
    The rally was organized by pro-Palestinian groups from all over Switzerland, 
    supported by partly radical, left-wing movements. National parties or NGOs were not involved, 
    however, Amnesty International teams monitored the demonstration.
